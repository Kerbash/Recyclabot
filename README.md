# Recyclabot
 
## Overview
We live in an era of convenience. From needing a ride across town to talking to someone from the across the world, a person need only depend on the small devices that they carry on them. Never before could so many things be done with just a simple touch of a button. But how can this technology of convenience be integrated to help with the rising issue of our land fills overflowing? One of the main reasons that the typical American does not recycle is simply because they do not know how to. Without the knowledge of what is and isn't recyclable, we risk potential recyclable goods ending up in landfills, adding to the giant masses of waste and decay or we risk non-recyclable goods contaminating the recyclable ones, which resorts to them being sent to aforementioned land fills! We saw this as an opportunity to try to use the power of machine learning to help solve this problem. A way to make recycling convenient. 

Recyclabot is (currently) a website that can be used to help with sorting through recyclables vs non-recyclables. All a user needs to do is upload an imagine and Recyclabot is able to distinguished whether or not the item in the photo belongs in the recycling bin. Recyclabot will also learn from user interaction so with every use, it will become more and more effective.  Recyclabot also keeps track of user interactions and there location, presenting the data, of what items are recycled globally and where.
